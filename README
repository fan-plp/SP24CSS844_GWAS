# now we have three text file named of listlane1, listlane2 and listlane3

# we will be performing step by step SNP calling for these reads using the lists genreated above.

#Step 1: use script "QC_first.sb" for quality check

#Step 2: use script "Trimmomatic.sb" for trimming the reads

#Step 3: use script "QC_second.sb" for quality check after trimming

#Step 4: now we can use either bowtie2 or bwa for mapping the reads

#option 1: use script "Bowtie2.sb" for indexing reference genome and mapping reads

#option 2: use script "bwa.sb" for indexing reference genome and mapping reads

#Step 5: use script "nQuire.sb" to sort ploidy level of each genome

#Step 6: SNP calling based on ploidy level. I did not get to this step since the module ends before I finish the step 5.would love to contibue the study if possible in the future
